This project was created initially for an undergraduate directed study in cryptography at Salisbury University. It implements several popular encryption algorithms in Java, including DES and AES.

Currently implemented cryptosystems:<br>
DES<br>
AES (Rijndael)<br>
Radix64 (base64)<br>

Currently under development:<br>
Serpent<br>
<br>
Currently under open development:<br>
RC4<br>
SHA1<br>
SHA2<br>
<br>
DISCLAIMER: THIS PROJECT IS NOT INTENDED TO BE CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY SECURE!!! IT IS TO DEMONSTRATE A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF SEVERAL POPULAR CRYPTOGRAPHIC METHODS AND SHOULD NOT BE USED IN ANY SITUATION WHERE STRONG CRYPTOGRAPHY IS REQUIRED!!!
